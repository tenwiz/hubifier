# Hubifier

Simple Chrome extension to show github notifications as native notifications.

## How to use

Download the extension from the releases page https://github.com/tenwiz/hubifier/releases

Drag the crx file to chrome and install it.

A new icon will appear next to your status bar and if you click it you will be prompted for a Private Access Token. You can get one following this instructions: https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line#creating-a-token

You just need notification permissions.

And that's about it, this extension was created mostly for personal use so it might work or it might not.

Tested only on macOS.

**Enjoy**
